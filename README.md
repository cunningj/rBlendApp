# rBlendApp
A speech therapy app I co-developed with Josh Quick as part of Project 1 for the Montana Code School. 
The app is a tool for speech therapists to use with children ages 5-10 to find and correct issues with R-blend pathology.

The main teaching components are a story as well as a matching game. The other component is a section for the therapist to organize their students and take progress notes.

Tech used:
node
express
webpack
babel
mongodb
mongoose
react
react-router
redux

fetch
bcrypt
